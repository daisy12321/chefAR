Augmented reality tool for learning to be a master chef at home

### Description
The tool is developed as part of the Reality/Virthually Hackathon at MIT in October 2017.

Cooking is hard and often intimidating to newcomers. Learning from online recipes and video tutorials takes one away from where the real action is. Turning to and from the computer, touching the keyboard with your meat-covered hands makes learning to cook a hassle rather than an enjoyable experience.

Our application leverages AR and AI to solve all that, and more. It integrates with your prep counter and stove top, provides step-by-step assessment, recommendation and instructions to guide you through the entire cooking experience through Hololens.

### Technology
We developed with the Microsoft Hololens in Unity. The toolkits and libraries used include Hololens Toolkit. All assets includes are constructed among the team members, or obtain from free open-source repositories.
